# Motivation

- US somewhat unique within advanced economies in design of safety net. System very federalized with various levels of government running programs.

- People apply to many programs and rules not harmonized and application is not automatic as in much of the developed world $\Rightarrow$ low take-up is more of issue in US than other places (.smallest[.red[Currie, 2006; Currie and Gahvari, 2008]]). 

- Social program take-up: Hot topic in public econ, yet understudied.
  - Emphasis on understanding role of barriers to accessing safety net.
  
-  Barriers impact both .hi-red[take-up] (how many people enroll) and .hi-red[targeting] (what types of people enroll). 

---

# SNAP

- Backbone of US safety net.

- Only US safety net program available to nearly all low-income households.

- Many potential barriers to access and rich literature studying these barriers.

# Literature

- Studies have explored .hi-red[take-up] and .hi-red[targeting] effects of SNAP policies/interventions

  - Information interventions (.smallest[.red[Daponte, Sanders, & Taylor, 1999; Finkelstein and Notowidigdo, 2019]])

  - Application help (.smallest[.red[Schanzenbach, 2001; Finkelstein and Notowidigdo, 2019]])

  - Certification rules and recertification interviews (.smallest[.red[Kabbani and Wilde, 2003; Homonoff and Somerville, 2021, Unrath, 2021]])

  - Simplified reporting requirements (.smallest[.red[Gray, 2018; Hanratty, 2006]])

  - Automated application process (.smallest[.red[Wu, 2021]])

- No evidence for improvements in both take-up and targeting

# Our Contribution

- First assessment of how access to in-person assistance via opening/closing SNAP offices and SNAP-authorized stores impacts participation and targeting.

- Provide evidence that reducing transaction costs via access to SNAP offices .hi-green[increases participation] and .hi-green[improves targeting].

--

- Link Census data on residential location with administrative SNAP data and information on SNAP offices and SNAP-authorized retailers.

- Not possible to study this question with existing surveys due to limited sample sizes and data quality issues.


- Study population within states and don’t have to focus samples with limited generalizability.

# Institutional Background & Data

---
# SNAP 
## Role of SNAP Offices

- Provide in-person assistance navigating application process.

- **Application prevalence**: .hi-red[in-person] $>$ online $>$ fax $>$ email $>$ phone.

  - SNAP offices report that typically 80% of applications are in person.
  
- Typically provide resources to connect SNAP applicants to other assistance programs (e.g., HUD, TANF, Medicaid/Medicare, LEAP, WIC).

- Some offices allow .red[direct applications to other programs] (typically TANF, but also sometimes HUD and Medicaid).

- Some offices even help find jobs, daycare, and housing.

# Measuring Access to SNAP Offices

- We count number of SNAP recipients in administrative records residing within given distance to each SNAP office in each year.

- In the case of overlap, we assign case to the closest office (i.e., .red["No Overlap"]).

- Most analyses focus on SNAP cases within **1 mile of the SNAP Office**.

  - Roughly **25th percentile** of distance distribution for both rural and urban counties.
  
---
# Share Affected by Openings/Closings

### Meaningful share of recipients live near SNAP offices

- Of the .hi-red[27,540,000 rural clients] we observe: <sup>*<sup/>

  - 695,000 live < 1 mile of opening office (781,000 for closing office).
  
- Of the .hi-blue[24,590,000 urban clients] we observe:

  - 452,000 live < 1 mile of opening office (843,000 for closing office).

# Empirical Design

## Preferred Specification - Two-way Fixed Effects

$$y_{it} = \sum_{\tau, \tau\neq 1}\beta_\tau 1(t-E_i = \tau) + \gamma_i + \theta_t + \epsilon_{it}$$
- $i\ -$ SNAP office

- $t\ -$ calendar year

- $E_i\ -$ year of opening/closing

--

- Panel design hinges on exogenous timing of openings/closings.

  - Unobserved determinants of SNAP participation not differentially trending  across office types.


---

# Empirical Design

$$y_{it} = \sum_{\tau, \tau\neq 1}\beta_\tau 1(t-E_i = \tau)+  \gamma_i + \theta_t + \epsilon_{it}$$

- Run on a panel balanced over main event times $\tau \in [-3,3]$.

- Coefficients estimated for all event times, but only report $\tau \in [-3,3]$.

- Cluster standard errors by SNAP office (location where SNAP office will be/is/used to be).

--


- Test robustness to heterogeneous treatment effects (.smallest[.red[de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfœuille, 2020]]).

# Mean Distance to Office (Miles)

- .hi-red[Goal:] Measure how travel distances are impacted by SNAP office openings/closings.

- Use the Census Master Address file (MAFX); a static file of all known residential locations in US.

- Measure average travel distance from every MAFX address within 1 of SNAP Office during years leading up to and following opening/closing.

# Mean Distance to Office (Miles)

- .hi-red[Rural Counties]: Open/closings change average distance by 5 miles.

- .hi-blue[Urban Counties]: Open/closings change average distance by 1-2 miles.

- **Key Takeaway:** Distances change enough to move from office being walkable to requiring transit to access.

--

Next, we explore impact of SNAP office closings and openings on total counts of new SNAP clients living within a mile radius.

---

# Conclusion

- Access to SNAP offices .hi-green[substantially increases program participation].

- Particularly important for families without income (i.e., .hi-green[improved targeting]).

- Interesting because many states are fully online with active help phone lines.

- Face-to-face assistance may provide additional aid overcoming transaction costs (.smallest[.red[Wu, 2021]])

- Policy implications to increase in-person assistance for applications.
  - Similar to mobile WIC clinics

---
# Next Steps

- Qualitatively examine mechanisms for why offices may matter.

- Similar analysis for distance to SNAP-authorized retailers and businesses more generally (D&B).

- Robustness to population changes.

- Mobility and case composition outcomes.

- Use as IV to explore impact of SNAP on labor supply, cross-program participation, and health.
